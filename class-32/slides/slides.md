<!-- .element style="width: 78%"-->

NOTE:

â€œThe loop illustrates that hunting is most effective when it's habitual and adaptable. Let's break it down step by step starting from what we call trailheads:

### A hunt starts with **Creating a Hypothesis**, or an educated guess, about some type of activity that might be going on in your IT environment.

- An example of a hypothesis could be that users who have recently traveled abroad are at elevated risk of being targeted by state-sponsored threat actors, so you might begin your hunt by planning to look for signs of new malware on their laptops or assuming that their accounts are being misused around your network.
- Hypotheses are typically formulated by analysts based on any number of factors, including friendly and threat intelligence.
- There are various ways that a hunter might form a hypothesis.
- Often this involves laying out attack models and the possible tactics a threat might use, determining what would already be covered by automated alerting systems, and then formulating a hunting investigation of what else might be happening.

### Hypotheses are **Investigated** via various **Tools and Techniques**, including Linked Data Search and visualization.

- Effective tools will leverage both raw and linked data analysis techniques such as visualization, statistical analysis or machine learning to fuse disparate cybersecurity datasets.
- Linked Data Analysis is particularly effective at laying out the data necessary to address the hypotheses in an understandable way, and so is a critical component for a hunting platform.
- Linked data can even add weights and directionality to visualizations, making it easier to search large data sets and use more powerful analytics.
- Many other complementary techniques exist, including row-oriented techniques such as stack counting and datapoint clustering.
- Analysts can use these techniques to easily discover new malicious patterns in their data and reconstruct complex attack paths to reveal an attacker's Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).

### **Tools and Techniques** uncover new malicious patterns of behavior and adversary TTPs.

- This is a critical part of the hunting cycle.
- An example of this process could be that a previous investigation revealed that a user account has been behaving anomalously, with the account sending an unusually high amount of outbound traffic.
- After conducting a Linked Data investigation, it is discovered that the user's account was initially compromised via an exploit targeting a third party service provider of the organization.
- New hypotheses and analytics are developed to specifically discover other user accounts affiliated with similar third party service providers.

### From successful hunts allow us to **Inform and Enrich automated analytics**.

- Don't waste your team's time doing the same hunts over and over.
- Once you find a technique that works to bring threats to light, automate it so that your team can continue to focus on the next new hunt.
- Information from these hunts can also be used to improve existing detection mechanisms.
- For example, you may uncover information that leads to new threat intelligence or indicators of compromise.
- You might even create some friendly intelligence, that is, information about your own environment and how it is meant to operate, such as network maps, software inventories, lists of authorized web servers, etc.
- The more you know about your own network, the better you can defend it, so it makes sense to try to record and leverage new findings as you encounter them on your hunts.

</div>

NOTE:

- What is an IOC?
  - Indicators of compromise (IOC) are pieces of forensic data that identify potentially malicious activity on a system or network.
    - Can be system log entries, data objects such as malicious system files recovered from a compromised machine, or network traffic indicating suspicious activity on the network.
      - Data objects determined to be IOCs are commonly referred to as artifacts.
      - Note that artifacts can be hashed to produce a unique signature, which is how signature-based malware detection software is able to determine if a file is malware.
    - IOCs help us answer the question, "What happened?"
    - Identified after the attack or incident has taken place.
    - Alerts, system log entries, files
    - IOCs are the "breadcrumbs" that lead to detection
    - Sometimes not the easiest to find
    - Here are some additional IOC examples that you may encounter in field:
      - Unusual Outbound Network Traffic
      - Anomalies in Privileged User Account Activity
      - Geographical Irregularities
      - Log-In Red Flags
      - Increases in Database Read Volume
      - HTML Response Sizes
      - Large Numbers of Requests for the Same File
      - Mismatched Port-Application Traffic
      - Suspicious Registry or System File Changes
      - Unusual DNS Requests
      - Unexpected Patching of Systems
      - Mobile Device Profile Changes
      - Bundles of Data in the Wrong Place
      - Web Traffic with Unhuman Behavior
      - Signs of DDoS Activity

CybOX, short for "Cyber Observable Expression," is an open standard for capturing and sharing structured information about cyber observables and events. It is a standardized way of representing and exchanging cyber threat intelligence, allowing security professionals and organizations to share information about threats, attacks, and indicators of compromise in a structured and standardized format.

CybOX was developed by the MITRE Corporation as part of the Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) initiative. It provides a common language for describing various aspects of cyber observables, which are the pieces of information that can be used to detect, analyze, and respond to cyber threats. Observables include things like IP addresses, domain names, file hashes, registry keys, network connections, and more.

Key features of CybOX include:

1. **Structured Representation:** CybOX uses a structured XML-based format to represent cyber observables, events, and relationships between them. This structured approach makes it easier to share and compare threat intelligence across different organizations and tools.

2. **Common Vocabulary:** CybOX defines a standardized vocabulary and data model for describing different types of cyber observables, ensuring consistency and clarity in threat intelligence sharing.

3. **Contextual Information:** CybOX allows for the inclusion of contextual information about the observables, such as timestamps, locations, and relationships to other observables. This helps provide a more complete picture of the threat landscape.

4. **Sharing and Interoperability:** By using a standardized format, CybOX enables security professionals to share threat intelligence with each other and across different security tools and platforms, enhancing collaboration and interoperability.

5. **Extensibility:** CybOX is designed to be extensible, allowing organizations to add custom fields and attributes to the standard schema to accommodate specific use cases or types of observables.

CybOX is one of the key standards within the Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX) framework, which is an overarching standard for sharing cyber threat intelligence. STIX provides a way to package and exchange threat intelligence in a comprehensive manner, combining CybOX for observables and TAXII (Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information) for transport and exchange.

Overall, CybOX plays a crucial role in the field of cyber threat intelligence by providing a common language and format for expressing and sharing information about cyber threats, attacks, and indicators of compromise.

# Demo & Lab

### Find Malicious Attack with Wireshark & Incident Reporting

NOTE:

### Import OVA File

### Demo: Find Malicious Attack with Wireshark & Incident Reporting

- How do we get the MD5 Hash of a target file in FLARE VM (Win10)?
  - `CertUtil -hashfile yourFileName MD5`
  - `CertUtil -hashfile yourFileName SHA256`
  - You can then upload the hash to VirusTotal. This is preferred over uploading the actual file. Discuss - Why?
  - Malware components won't always test positive on VirusTotal, but may still be relevant to the investigation. Why?
- How do we use alerts to inform our Wireshark analysis?
  - Open alerts for demo2 and use ports and IPs to filter Wireshark. Surprisingly simple yet effective.
- DO: Show class the Wireshark cheat sheet and share the link
- Refresh on how to filter Wireshark PCAPs by:
  - IP
  - TCP Port
  - Source IP
  - Dest IP
  - URL
  - Host name
- How to "follow a TCP stream" to reconstruct the data
  - Right click a TCP packet and Follow > TCP Stream.
- How to export a file from HTTP traffic
  - File > Export File > HTTP
- Walk through a demo together in class that's similar to today's lab
