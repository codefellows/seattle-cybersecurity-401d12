# Encryption

<div>

- &shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->**Encryption** is the act of transforming plaintext into ciphertext.
  - Ensures data confidentiality. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Encryption uses a cipher, or mathematical algorithm, to transform readable plaintext into unreadable ciphertext. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

</div>

NOTE:

- Encryption
  - Encryption is the act of transforming plaintext into ciphertext.
  - Encryption uses a cipher, or mathematical algorithm, to transform readable plaintext into unreadable ciphertext.

# Encryption

<br>

![Image](/ops-401-cybersecurity-guide/curriculum/class-06/slides/assets/05_02.png)

NOTE:
Data encryption uses a special program to scramble the data on your computer, and an encryption key to revert it to its prior, readable state. You can use it to reliably protect the files and folders on your computer in Windows 10.

---

<!-- .element class="text-only" -->
# Ciphertext

<div>

- &shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->**Ciphertext** is the altered form of a plaintext message, so as to be unreadable for anyone except the intended recipients.
  - Something that has been turned into a secret. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
  - Ensures data confidentiality. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Plaintext is human readable. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

</div>

---

<!-- .element class="text-only" -->
# Decryption

<div>

- &shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->**Decryption** is the reverse process from encryption.
  - Converts a ciphertext message back into plaintext through <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
  - Uses a cryptographic algorithm and the appropriate key that was used to do the original encryption. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

</div>

NOTE:

- Decryption
  - Decryption is the act of transforming ciphertext back to its original plaintext.

<!-- .element class="text-only" -->
# Hashing

<div>

- &shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->**Hashing** is a process that generates a unique hash value for a given data.
  - Can target a file or a string, for example. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- &shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->A **hash value** is a unique value that corresponds to the content of the file.
  - Message Digest 5 (MD5) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
  - Secure Hashing Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
  - SHA-2 <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->
  - NTLM <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7" -->
  - LANMAN <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="8" -->

</div>

NOTE:

- Hash value
  - Hashing is the simplest type of cryptographic operation.
  - A cryptographic hashing algorithm produces a fixed length string from an input plaintext that can be of any length.
  - The output can be referred to as a checksum, message digest, or hash. The function is designed so that it is impossible to recover the plaintext data from the digest (one-way) and so that different inputs are unlikely to produce the same output (a collision).
  - Common hashing algorithms include:
    - Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) is considered the strongest algorithm and appears in different variants, the most popular being SHA-256.
    - Message Digest Algorithm #5 (MD5) produces a 128-bit digest and is generally not considered as secure as SHA-256.
  - Note that a hash value cannot be decrypted. Rather, it can be "cracked" using such techniques as a rainbow table.

# Data States

<div>

<div>

- &shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->**Data at rest**
  - The data is in some sort of persistent storage media. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- &shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->**Data in transit (or data in motion)**
  - The data is being transmitted over a network. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
  - Examples <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
    - Website traffic <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->
    - Remote access traffic <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7" -->
    - Data being synchronized between cloud repositories <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="8" -->
- &shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="9" -->**Data in use (or data in processing)**
  - Data is present in volatile memory <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="10" -->
    - RAM <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="11" -->
    - CPU registers and caches <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="12" -->

NOTE:

- What are the three types of data states?
  - "Data at restâ€”this state means that the data is in some sort of persistent storage media.
- Data in transit (or data in motion) is the state when data is transmitted over a network
  - Examples of types of data that may be in transit include website traffic, remote access traffic, data being synchronized between cloud repositories, and more.
  - In this state, data can be protected by a transport encryption protocol, such as TLS or IPSec.
- Data in use (or data in processing) is the state when data is present in volatile memory, such as system RAM or CPU registers and cache."

# Data in Motion

<div>

<div>

- &shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->**Data confidentiality**
  - PII, trade secrets, customer lists, key employee salaries, marketing strategies, source codes, etc. fall into the wrong hands. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- &shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->**Data integrity**
  - Data remains unchanged <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
  - Or if changed, you can be made aware <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
- &shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->**Data source authenticity**

# TLS

<div>

<div>

- &shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->**Transport Layer Security (TLS)**
  - Typically used with the HTTP application (referred to as HTTPS or HTTP Secure) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
  - Can also be used to secure other application protocols and as a virtual private networking (VPN) solution. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
  - Versions 1.3, 1.2, 1.1. 1.0 <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
- &shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->**Downgrade attack**
  - Man-in-the-middle tries to force the use of a weak cipher suite and SSL/TLS version. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->
  - TLS 1.3 is impervious to downgrade attack. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7" -->

</div>

</div>

</div>

NOTE:

- HTTP communications are not secured.
- Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) was developed by Netscape in the 1990s to address the lack of security in HTTP.
  - SSL was quickly adopted as a standard named Transport Layer Security (TLS).
  - It is typically used with the HTTP application (referred to as HTTPS or HTTP Secure) but can also be used to secure other application protocols and as a virtual private networking (VPN) solution.
  - While the acronym SSL is still used, the Transport Layer Security versions are the only ones that are safe to use.
    - A server can provide support for legacy clients, but obviously this is less secure.
    - For example, a TLS 1.2 server could be configured to allow clients to downgrade to TLS 1.1 or 1.0 or even SSL 3.0 if they do not support TLS 1.2.
- A downgrade attack is where a man-in-the-middle tries to force the use of a weak cipher suite and SSL/TLS version.
- TLS version 1.3 was approved in 2018.
  - One of the main features of TLS 1.3 is the removal of the ability to perform downgrade attacks by preventing the use of unsecure features and algorithms from previous versions.
  - There are also changes to the handshake protocol to reduce the number of messages and speed up connections.

# Demo

NOTE:

Reference [How are passwords stored in Linux (Understanding hashing with shadow utils)](https://www.slashroot.in/how-are-passwords-stored-linux-understanding-hashing-shadow-utils) for this demonstration.

Demonstrate where Linux stores its passwords.

- `/etc/passwd`
- `/etc/shadow`

Let's understand each and every field of the output of /etc/passwd, that are separated by a ":".

- `Username` - what you type when you log into the system.
- `Password` - this field is set to 'x', and the password is stored in /etc/shadow
- `UID` - User identifier assigned to each user. Used by the OS to refer to a user
- `GID` - User's group identifier number
- `GECOS` - or full name of the user. This field contains a list of comma-separated values with the following information: User's full name, Room number, work phone number, home phone number, other contact information.
- `Home directory` - Absolute path to the user's home directory. Contains the user's file and configurations.
- `Login Shell` - the absolute path to the user's login shell. The shell that is started when the user logs into the system.

Let's understand each and every field of the output of /etc/passwd, that are separated by a ":".

- `Username` - what you type when you log into the system
- `Password` - encrypted password in hash format
- `Last password change` - The date of the last password change
- `Minimum` - minimum number of days required between password changes
- `Maximum` - maximum number of days the password is valid, after that user is forced to change passwords again
- `Warn` - number of days before password is to expire that user is warned that the password must be changed
- `Inactive` - number of days after password expires that account is disabled
- `Expire` - The date of expiration of the account, expressed as the number of days since Jan 1, 1970

Demonstrate the process of putting a public key in the `.ssh/authorized_keys` file and test the SSH connection.

After this, demonstrate SCP command syntax. Students will need to perform SCP from their local box to their EC2 box for this lab.

Example syntax: `scp your_username@remotehost.edu:foobar.txt /some/local/directory`
