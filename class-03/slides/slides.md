- PaaS
  - Platform and environment for developing, testing and deploying applications
  - Focus on application rather than managing infrastructure
- SaaS

<div>

- &shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->**Risk**
  - The likelihood and impact of a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- &shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->**Vulnerability**
  - A weakness that could be triggered accidentally or exploited intentionally to cause a security breach. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
- &shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->**Threat**
  - The potential for someone or something to exploit a vulnerability, whether intentional or unintentional. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->

NOTE:

- Why do we need to learn how to communicate risk?
  - Our core mission is to mitigate cyber risk.
- What are due care and due diligence?
  - Showing due care and due diligence is the only way to disprove negligence in an occurrence of loss.
  - Due care is using reasonable care to protect the interests of an organization.
    - Example: Developing a formalized security structure including policies and procedures.
  - Due diligence is practicing the activities that maintain the due care effort.
    - Example: continued application of this security structure onto the IT infrastructure
- What is risk?
  - CompTIA indicates there is a relationship between vulnerability, threat, and risk.
  - A vulnerability is a weakness that could be triggered accidentally or exploited intentionally to cause a security breach.
  - A threat is the potential for someone or something to exploit a vulnerability and breach security. A threat may be intentional or unintentional.
  - Risk is the likelihood and impact (or consequence) of a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability.

- Risk Identification: Identify potential risks to the organization's systems, assets, and operations.
- Risk Analysis: Assess and analyze risks based on their impact and likelihood.
- Risk Evaluation: Evaluate the significance of identified risks and their potential impact on the organization.
- Risk Treatment: Implement appropriate strategies to mitigate, transfer, accept, or avoid risks.

- &shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->**Quantitative risk analysis**
  - Uses numerical data and mathematical models to assess and quantify risks <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
  - Assigns monetary values to risk components. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
  - Allows for cost-benefit analysis, return on investment calculations, and prioritization of risk mitigation efforts <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

NOTE:

- Quantitative risk management involves using measurable data, numerical analysis, and mathematical models to assess and quantify risks.
- It assigns numerical values to risks, such as probabilities, frequencies, and financial impact, to make informed decisions based on objective metrics.
- It provides a quantitative understanding of risks, allowing for cost-benefit analysis, return on investment calculations, and prioritization of risk mitigation efforts.

NOTE:

- Asset Value (AV) – How much is the asset worth?
- Exposure factor (EF) – Percentage of Asset Value lost?
- Single Loss Expectancy (SLE):
  - What does it cost if it happens once?
  - SLE = AV x EF
- Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO) is how often this will happen per year.
- Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) is what it cost per year if we do nothing.
  - ALE = SLE x ARO
- Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) is the mitigation cost: upfront + ongoing cost (Normally Operational)

NOTE:

- Risk Mitigation/Response
  - Risk avoidance
    - Determining that the impact and/or likelihood of a specific risk is too great to be offset by the potential benefits and not performing a certain business function because of that determination.
  - Risk mitigation
    - Putting security controls in place to attenuate the possible impact and/or likelihood of a specific risk.
  - Risk transference
    - Paying an external party to accept the financial impact of a given risk.
    - Example: Cyber insurance
